This tutorial by Ophir Tanz and Cambron Carter is a fun high-level math-free tutorial on neural networks and in particular, goes into more depth on convolutional neural networks - a form of neural network with multiple layers of processing that forms the basis for many deep learning systems today (see the Deep Learning lecture for more details).
